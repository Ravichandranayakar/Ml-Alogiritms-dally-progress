# Machine Learning Algorithms - Daily Progress

This repository tracks my **daily progress in learning Machine Learning algorithms** with hands-on projects and notes.  
The goal is to understand each algorithm deeply by building **real-world projects** and documenting the learning journey.

##  Algorithms Checklist

-  **Linear Regression** 
-  **Logistic Regression** 
-  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 
-  **Decision Trees**   
-  **Random Forest** 
-  **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** 
-  **Naive Bayes** 

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML Models & Evaluation)  

---

##  Learning Approach
1. Learn one algorithm at a time  
2. Build at least **one project** for each algorithm  
3. Compare results with other algorithms  
4. Document key learnings in this repo
