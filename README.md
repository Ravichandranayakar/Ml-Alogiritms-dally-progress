# Machine Learning Algorithms - Daily Progress

This repository tracks my **daily progress in learning Machine Learning algorithms** with hands-on projects and notes.  
The goal is to understand each algorithm deeply by building **real-world projects** and documenting the learning journey.

  - **HeartGuard Predictor.ipynb**
  
- **Decision Trees**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **XGBoost**

### Unsupervised Learning
- **KMeans Clustering**
- **PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)**

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML Models & Evaluation)

## Learning Approach
1. Learn one algorithm at a time  
2. Building  **one project** for each algorithm  
3. Compare results with other algorithms  
4. Document key learnings in this repo
